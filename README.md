This is a simple Anki addon that checks when a note is added whether a pitch accent field is in the Kanjium style and converts into the Javdejong style. Used when adding notes through Yomichan (and successors) and the dictionary uses Kanjium style notation and you prefer Javdejong which is also the default in the [AJT Japanese addon](https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/Japanese).
